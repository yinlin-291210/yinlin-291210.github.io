Hye, my name is Lin Bao. I am currently a front-end programmer. I have been practicing for two and a half years. I like to write code, rap, play games, and exercise. I know a little about music and movies, so I also want to be an artist, but I am actually a daydreamer.

At present, I am in Suzhou. I like Suzhou and want to have a home in Suzhou.

Bye...
